From the 2007 year on, all countriesÂ have toÂ supply gross income information.<strong>Â </strong>Â </p> <p>The current definition of total household disposable income used for the calculation of EU-SILC based indicators excludes:</p> <p>- imputed rent - i.e. money that one saves on full (market) rent by living in one's own accommodation or in accommodation rented at a price that is lower than the market rent,</p> <p>- non monetary income components, in particular value of goods produced for own consumption, social transfers in kind and non-cash employee income except company cars.</p> <p>Â </p> <p><strong>Equivalence scale:</strong></p> <p style="text-align: justify;">To take into account the impact of differences in household size and composition, the total disposable household income is "equivalised". The equivalised income attributed to each member of the household is calculated by dividing the total disposable income of the household by the equivalisation factor. Equivalisation factors can be determined in various ways. Eurostat applies an equivalisation factor calculated according to the OECD-modified scale first proposed in 1994 - which gives a weight of 1.0 to the first person aged 14 or more, a weight of 0.5 to other persons aged 14 or more and a weight of 0.3 to persons aged 0-13.</p> <p>Â </p> <p><strong>Household definition:</strong></p> <p style="text-align: justify;">AÂ 'private household' means "a person living alone or a group of people who live together in the same private dwelling and share expenditures, including the joint provision of the essentials of living". EU-SILC implementing regulation number 1983/2003 on updated definitions, defines households in terms of sharing household expenses and (for non-permanent members) in terms of duration of stay and (for temporarily absent members) in terms of duration of absence.</p> <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Household type:</span></p> <p style="text-align: justify;">A common classification was developed by Eurostat for use in data collection surveys including ECHP, LFS, HBS and EU-SILC as well as the subsequent presentation of indicators relating to income, housing, education, healthcare, etc. Rather than focussing on "couples" and/or "families", the classification is constructed by reference to the numbers of adult members, their age and gender, and the numbers of dependent children living with them.

These indicators are an essential element in the Open Method of Coordination (OMC) to monitor the progress of Member States in the fight against poverty and social exclusion. The European Council adopted in March 2006 a new framework for the social protection and social inclusion process. While EU countries have different policies in the area of social inclusion, pensions, health and long-term care, they have agreed common objectives in this area, as well as common indicators so that they can compare best practices and measure progress. A set of 14 headline indicators is complemented by specific indicators relating to three main areas: poverty and social exclusion, pensions, and health and long-term care. The list of indicators was approved in 2006, and updated for health in 2008 and for material deprivation and housing in 2009.</p> <p style="text-align: justify;">At the European Council held on 17 June 2010, the Member states' Heads of State and Government endorsed a new EU strategy for jobs and smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, known as the Europe 2020 strategy. The strategy will help Europe to recover from the crisis and come out stronger, both internally and at the international level, by boosting competitiveness, productivity, growth potential, social cohesion and economic convergence. The poverty issue is a milestone in the Europe 2020 strategy. One of the headline targets is "Reduction of poverty by aiming to lift at least 20 million people out of the risk of poverty or social exclusion".</p> <p>For more information on policy developments, refer to the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=753&langId=en">European Commission's website</a>.</p></td>

      <tr> 
       <td class="Cl-Content"><p style="text-align: justify;">A satisfaction survey of users of EU-SILC was conducted in 2010. 68 users of EU-SILC responded to the user survey. Forthe majority, both aggregates and micro-data were important or essential in their work irrespective of the purpose of their use. Moreover, the frequency of use of the statistics was high, particularly for anonymized cross-sectional micro-data. The survey has shown that EU-SILC is of very high relevance for users.</p> <p style="text-align: justify;">The use of the ad-hoc modules was less widespread than the use of the primary variables. Nevertheless there was high interest to repeat these modules in order to have the possibility of comparing data over time The EU-SILC's legal basis specifies that the variables covered by the modules are to be collected every four years or less frequently. As stated above the modules of 2011 and 2012 will cover topics very similar to those of 2005 and 2007 respectively.</p> <p style="text-align: justify;">The overall quality of EU-SILC data was rated as adequate to good. Among the various dimensions, coherence was rated highest for both micro-data and aggregated statistics. Accuracy was the most important aspect for users and scored highly in the quality assessment.</p> <p style="text-align: justify;">Comparability across countries for aggregated data was the least appreciated factor, being rated 'Adequate', but it was very important for users. The users also considered the metadata provided about differences between national practices and methods as insufficient. Timeliness also needed improvement according to the users but this should not be achieved at the expense of accuracy.</p> <p style="text-align: justify;">The quality of micro-data received slightly lower scores. Users were least satisfied with their completeness. However, it appears that they labelled as lack of completeness the absence from EU-SILC of variables that they would like to have data about, rather than the unavailability of data required by legislation.Â  Moreover, some users emphasized their strong need for more detailed micro-data which is not possible under the current legal framework and that the current procedure to obtain access to the micro-data is cumbersome.</p> <p style="text-align: justify;">Although Eurostat provides full documentation on both cross-sectional and longitudinal micro-data to users, some of them considered the information on longitudinal data not sufficient. A few users stated that longitudinal data are often difficult to use and that they do not understand how the weights were constructed and how to use them for panel data analysis. Another issue was the inability to link the information of the cross-sectional and longitudinal components, which, some users believe, limits the utility of the data. However, this lack of linkage is due to legal provisions.</p> <p style="text-align: justify;">Poverty, well being, material deprivation and child poverty, the particular topics that Eurostat indicated as potential areas of expansion of EU-SILC, attracted the attention of many users, showing Eurostat's good understanding of their needs. Most of them considered additional breakdowns of the disseminated poverty indicators as most important. Additionally, needs expressed spontaneously by users referred most to data on income and benefits but also to household characteristics, health, social and living conditions, education and labour status characteristics.</p> <p style="text-align: justify;">Finally, users were satisfied with overall quality of the service delivered by Eurostat, which encompasses data quality and the supporting service provided to them.</p></td>

The sampling frame and methods of sample selection should ensure that every individual and household in the target population is assigned a known and non-zero probability of selection.</p> <p style="text-align: justify;">Regulation 1177/2003 defines the minimum effective sample sizes to be achieved, i.e. the actual sample sizes will have to be larger to the extent that the design effect exceeds 1.0 and to compensate for all kinds of non-response. Furthermore, the sample size refers to the number of valid households which are households for which, and for all members of which, all or nearly all the required information has been obtained. The allocation of the effective sample size is done according to the size of the country and ensuring minimum precision criteria for the key indicator at national level (absolute precision of the at-risk-of-poverty rate of 1%).</p></td>

      <tr> 
       <td class="Cl-Content"><p>The term 'non-sampling error' is a generic one that encompasses any errors other than sampling errors. The non-sampling errors discussed in this section are: coverage errors, measurement and processing errors, and non-response errors.</p> <p>Â </p> <p><strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Coverage errors</span></em></strong></p> <p>Coverage errors are caused by the imperfections of a sampling frame for the target population of the survey.</p> <p>In EU-SILC two main groups can be defined in terms of the sampling source used:</p> 
        <ul> 
         <li style="text-align: justify;">Some countries have relied on household information from population registers. In order to make the best coverage of the target population, registers have to be updated frequently. It means any modification in the population (both people moving in and people moving out) must be reported as quickly as possible.</li> 
         <li>Other countries have used Census databases in order to select addresses. The databases also have to be updated to represent the units that have come into being after the Census and thus ensure the cross-sectional representativeness of the sample.</li> 
        </ul> <p>A systematic source of coverage problems is the time lag between the reference date for the selection of the sample and the fieldwork period, which should be made the shortest.Â </p> <p>In addition, some countries carried out EU-SILC as a sub-sample of the units (addresses) that successfully cooperated to other existing surveys. Assuming selective non-response in these surveys, this may entail selection bias (under-coverage).</p> <p>Â </p> <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>Measurement and processing errors</strong></em></span></p> <p>Generally, measurement errors arise from the questionnaire, the interviewer, the interviewee and the data collection method used.</p> <p style="text-align: justify;">It is vital in a survey like EU-SILC, which collects a multitude of complex income components, that the questionnaire is constructed so that the interviewee can provide as quickly as possible all the correct information. It appears that most of the countries took care in designing the questionnaire. In particular, experiences from pilot surveys and/or former EU-SILC waves were used in order to optimize the data collection process. The questionnaires were also tested in order to identify potential sources of problems.Â </p> <p style="text-align: justify;">Due to the complexity and the sensitivity of the survey, the interviewees could not or did not want to give information about all their incomes. For instance, capital of self-employment income may have been under-reported. Besides, EU-SILC collects non-monetary income components (imputed rent, income from private use of company car...) that could have an unfamiliar terminology to some people. The risk of confusion on the information to report is then higher than with more conventional monetary income components.</p> <p>Â </p> <p><strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Non-response errors</span></em></strong></p> <p style="text-align: justify;">All surveys have to deal with non-response, i.e. information missing for some of the sample units. Unit non-response happens when no interview can be obtained, while item non-response does when only some of the items are missing. EU-SILC suffers from these two types of non-response:</p> 
        <ul> 
         <li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Unit non-response</span>: when a household refuses to cooperate or is away during the fieldwork period. Other reasons can explain unit non-response: the questionnaire is lost; the household is unable to respond because of incapacity or illness... It may also happen that a person in a household refuses to cooperate although the household interview has been accepted ('individual' non-response).</li> 
         <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Item non-response</span>: typically happens to questions the interviewee does not answer because he considers them personal or not easily understandable.</li> 
        </ul> <p style="text-align: justify;">Non-response is a potential source of bias particularly if the non-responding units have specific survey patterns ('non-ignorable' non-response). For instance, one might expect persons with high incomes to be more reluctant to give income information to an interviewer, thus making the upper income class under-represented in the sample and the estimates downwardly biased.Â </p> <p>The Commission Regulation 28/2004 has defined indicators aiming at measuring unit non-response in EU-SILC: Address contact rate (Ra), Household response rate (Rh), Individual response rate (Rp).Â </p> <p style="text-align: justify;">At this step, elaborate models controlling many external control variables are desirable in order to correct non-response. Most of the countries did apply either a standard post-stratification based on homogeneous response groups or a more sophisticated logistic regression model.Â </p> <p>Individual non-response rate appears to be marginal. Most of the countries have actually imputed missing individual questionnaires.Â </p> <p style="text-align: justify;">Item non-response is high for some income components. It has been dealt with by imputation. The technique aims at 'filling the holes' in a distribution, so only unit non-response can be assumed. However, it has to be kept in mind imputed values are not exact values and underlain on a model that could not be the perfect fit of the reality.Â </p> <p style="text-align: justify;">Imputation can have a significant effect on the overall accuracy: it generally skews a sample distribution so estimates will be biased. Furthermore, variance estimates assuming that imputed values are exact ones will be generally biased. The impact of imputation on the EU-SILC data is difficult to assess as yet.Â </p> <p>Total non-response of selected household/individuals is required to be below 40%.</p> <p style="text-align: justify;">Item non-response for non income variable is limited to 5%. When non-response in income components affects a subcomponent collected through interview, statistical imputation or modelling is required. This aspect is controlled in the datasets through imputation flags which represent the proportion of collected over recorded amounts.</p></td>

       <td class="Cl-Content"><p>To ensure comparability of data and/or indicators, i.e. to ensure quality of data as defined by Eurostat, EU-SILC has opted for an ex-ante output harmonization strategy.</p> <p style="text-align: justify;">When using output harmonization it is the goal that is determined, survey design and methods are flexible as long as the output requirements are met. Countries have to define suitable national concepts and measurement procedures with which the international concept can be portrayed. There are two different strategies depending on when the survey design is planned: with ex-ante harmonization, the surveys are created by the countries having in mind the output to produce; with ex-post harmonization, countries can adapt surveys already in place to produce comparable outcomes.</p> <p style="text-align: justify;">EU-SILC is based on a common framework defined by harmonized lists of target primary and secondary variables, common concepts, a recommended design, common requirements (for imputation, weighting, sampling errors calculation) and classifications aiming at maximising comparability of the information produced.</p> <p style="text-align: justify;">To anchor EU-SILC in the National Statistical System, survey design is flexible. The framework can be seen as a trade off in terms of standardisation of surveys leading to a good degree of comparability and flexibility allowing country's specificities to be taken into account in order to maximise quality of data. Eurostat and Member States work together to develop common guidelines and procedures aimed at maximising comparability.</p> <p>The EU-SILC common framework aims ensuring standardisation at different levels.</p> <p>1) Conceptual standardisation is achieved because the common concepts/definitions underlying each measure/variable, the scope and time reference are defined and documented.</p> <p style="text-align: justify;">2) Implementation and process standardisation is achieved by editing recommendations about collection unit to be considered, sample size to be achieved for each country, a recommended design for implementing EU-SILC (the so called 4-year rotational panel which almost all countries are using), common requirements for sampling and tracing rules for the longitudinal components, common requirement for imputation and weighting procedures. International classifications aiming at maximising comparability of the information produced are also enforced. Specific fieldwork aspects are also controlled by the framework: to limit the use of proxy interviews; to limit the use of controlled substitutions, to limit the interval between the end of the income reference period and the time of the interview, to limit to the extent for the total fieldwork of one-shot surveys, to define precise follow up rules of individuals and households in case of refusals, non-contact...</p> <p style="text-align: justify;">EU-SILC flexibility is a key aspect allowing for adaptation to national specificities in terms of infrastructure and measurement.Â  The most important element of the flexibility is related to the data sources (administrative or interview) to be used. Eurostat encouraged the use of existing ones, whether they are surveys or registers. A second aspect of the flexibility is related to the survey and sampling design. The only constrain is that, for both, the cross-sectional and longitudinal components, all household and personal data have to be linkable at micro level. Countries can use survey vehicles already in place, set up a new survey possibly drawing on one recommended by Eurostat. Sampling design can draw on expertise for social survey at national level. The third element of flexibility relates to the measure of self-employment income for which the diversity of the source and practice did not allow to find common harmonised solutions.</p></td>
